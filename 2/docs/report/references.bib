    abstract = "Emotions are expressed in nuanced ways, which varies by collective or individual experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks."

ABSTRACT = {Dataset size is considered a major concern in the medical domain, where lack of data is a common occurrence. This study aims to investigate the impact of dataset size on the overall performance of supervised classification models. We examined the performance of six widely-used models in the medical field, including support vector machine (SVM), neural networks (NN), C4.5 decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), adaboost (AB), and naïve Bayes (NB) on eighteen small medical UCI datasets. We further implemented three dataset size reduction scenarios on two large datasets and analyze the performance of the models when trained on each resulting dataset with respect to accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Our results indicated that the overall performance of classifiers depend on how much a dataset represents the original distribution rather than its size. Moreover, we found that the most robust model for limited medical data is AB and NB, followed by SVM, and then RF and NN, while the least robust model is DT. Furthermore, an interesting observation is that a robust machine learning model to limited dataset does not necessary imply that it provides the best performance compared to other models.},
