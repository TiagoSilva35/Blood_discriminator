\begin{abstract}
Blood cell classification is a critical task in medical diagnosis and hematological analysis. 
The present work conducts a comparative study between two deep learning architectures for blood cell
classification supported by the BloodMNIST dataset. We implement and evaluate two neural network 
architectures: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Multi-Layer Neural Network (MLNN). 
Besides implementation details we created an evaluation framework composed by three dimensions:
quality (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), efficacy (sensitivity, specificity), 
and efficiency (training time, inference time). Experimental results support the theoretical
superiority of CNN architectures for image-based classification tasks, showing
significantly better performance than traditional fully-connected networks although the imbalanced
nature of the dataset poses challenges for both architectures.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Dataset}

We utilize the BloodMNIST dataset from the MedMNIST collection. The dataset characteristics are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Image Size}: 28$\times$28 pixels, RGB (3 channels)
    \item \textbf{Classes}: 8 blood cell types
    \item \textbf{Training Set}: 11,959 images
    \item \textbf{Validation Set}: 1,712 images
    \item \textbf{Test Set}: 3,421 images
    \item \textbf{Total}: 17,092 images
\end{itemize}

Because the dataset is already preprocessed and normalized, we focus on the model architectures and training procedures rather than data augmentation techniques.
As expected in medical datasets, class imbalance exists, with some cell types being underrepresented. This is addressed in the evaluation phase using metrics sensitive to class distribution
to ensure a more robust assessment of model performance.
\subsection{Model Architectures}

\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}

Our CNN architecture consists of three convolutional blocks followed by fully-connected layers. The design follows the principle of progressively increasing feature channels while reducing spatial dimensions:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{CNN Architecture}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input:} $x \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times 3 \times 28 \times 28}$
\STATE \textbf{Conv1:} Conv2d(3 $\rightarrow$ 32, kernel=3, padding=1) + ReLU + MaxPool(2)
\STATE \quad Output: $\mathbb{R}^{B \times 32 \times 14 \times 14}$
\STATE \textbf{Conv2:} Conv2d(32 $\rightarrow$ 64, kernel=3, padding=1) + ReLU + MaxPool(2)
\STATE \quad Output: $\mathbb{R}^{B \times 64 \times 7 \times 7}$
\STATE \textbf{Conv3:} Conv2d(64 $\rightarrow$ 128, kernel=3, padding=1) + ReLU + MaxPool(2)
\STATE \quad Output: $\mathbb{R}^{B \times 128 \times 3 \times 3}$
\STATE \textbf{Flatten:} $\mathbb{R}^{B \times 1152}$
\STATE \textbf{FC1:} Linear(1152 $\rightarrow$ 256) + ReLU
\STATE \textbf{FC2:} Linear(256 $\rightarrow$ 128) + ReLU
\STATE \textbf{FC3:} Linear(128 $\rightarrow$ 8)
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Logits $\in \mathbb{R}^{B \times 8}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The architecture rationale:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Progressive channel expansion} (32$\rightarrow$64$\rightarrow$128): Captures increasingly complex features
    \item \textbf{Spatial dimension reduction} (28$\rightarrow$14$\rightarrow$7$\rightarrow$3): Achieved through max-pooling with stride 2
    \item \textbf{Padding=1}: Preserves spatial dimensions within each convolutional layer
    \item \textbf{ReLU activation}: Introduces non-linearity and mitigates vanishing gradients
    \item \textbf{Multi-stage FC layers}: Provides smooth transition from feature maps to class predictions
\end{itemize}

Total parameters: 422,344 parameters.

\textbf{Architecture Design Rationale:}

The number of convolutional layers resulted from balancing model complexity and computational efficiency.
Given the input, we recognized that three convolutional layers would provide enough feature extraction
while not over-reducing the spatial dimensions.
The channel progression and kernel sizes were selected based on established (state-of-the-art) CNN design principles proven and discussed in theoretical classes.
In addition, the fully-connected layers were sized to gradually reduce the feature representation to the final class logits
(preventing abrupt bottlenecks).
Of course the design could be further optimized through hyperparameter tuning, but this architecture serves as a solid baseline
(experimentally validated in the results section).


\subsubsection{Multi-Layer Neural Network (MLNN)}

The MLNN architecture uses only fully-connected layers:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{MLNN Architecture}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input:} $x \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times 3 \times 28 \times 28}$
\STATE \textbf{Flatten:} $x \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times 2352}$ (where $2352 = 3 \times 28 \times 28$)
\STATE \textbf{FC1:} Linear(2352 $\rightarrow$ $h_1$) + ReLU
\STATE \textbf{FC2-FCn:} Linear($h_{i-1}$ $\rightarrow$ $h_i$) + ReLU (for $n$ hidden layers)
\STATE \textbf{Output Layer:} Linear($h_n$ $\rightarrow$ 8)
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Logits $\in \mathbb{R}^{B \times 8}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Hidden layer size calculation:
\begin{equation}
h = \frac{n_{input} + n_{classes}}{2} = \frac{2352 + 8}{2} = 1180
\end{equation}

This heuristic balances model capacity with computational efficiency.

\textbf{Architecture Design Rationale:}

The hidden layer size calculation using the average of input and output dimensions is a simple heuristic
that provides reasonable capacity without excessive parameters. For a single hidden layer configuration,
this results in 1,180 hidden units, creating a bottleneck architecture (2352 → 1180 → 8) that forces
the network to learn compressed representations. While this approach can work for simple classification tasks,
it fundamentally treats each pixel as an independent feature, ignoring the 2D spatial relationships that
characterize cell morphology.

The MLNN architecture serves primarily as a pedagogical baseline to demonstrate why CNNs are preferred
for image classification. The lack of translation invariance, the enormous first-layer parameter count
(2.77M parameters just in the first layer), and the immediate loss of spatial structure highlight
the architectural advantages of convolutional approaches. This comparison validates theoretical understanding
through empirical evidence in the context of blood cell classification.

\subsection{Training Configuration}

Table~\ref{tab:hyperparameters} presents the complete hyperparameter configuration used in our experiments.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Experimental Hyperparameters}
\label{tab:hyperparameters}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{CNN} & \textbf{DNN} \\
\midrule
Learning Rate & 0.001 & 0.01 \\
Optimizer & Adam & Adam \\
Loss Function & CrossEntropyLoss & CrossEntropyLoss \\
Batch Size & 128 & 128 \\
Epochs & 15 & 10 \\
Hidden Layers & - & 1 \\
Hidden Size & - & 1180 \\
Weight Initialization & He & He \\
Activation Function & ReLU & ReLU \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Training Configuration Rationale:}

The training configuration was selected to balance convergence speed, computational efficiency, and generalization performance.
CrossEntropyLoss was chosen as the standard loss function for multi-class classification, combining LogSoftmax and NLLLoss
for numerical stability. The Adam optimizer (with default parameters $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$) provides adaptive
per-parameter learning rates that naturally handle the varying gradient magnitudes across different network depths,
eliminating the need for manual learning rate scheduling in our 15-epoch training regime.

The learning rate of 0.001 represents the standard default for Adam in computer vision tasks. Preliminary experiments
(not detailed here) validated this choice: higher rates (0.01) caused training instability, while lower rates (0.0001)
converged too slowly. The selected rate achieves smooth monotonic loss decrease (1.58 → 0.313) without oscillations,
with test performance plateauing around epoch 12, indicating appropriate convergence behavior.

A batch size of 128 samples was selected for computational and statistical reasons. This size fits comfortably in
modern GPU memory while maximizing throughput, provides more stable gradient estimates than smaller mini-batches (32-64),
and maintains reasonable generalization (very large batches can degrade generalization). With 11,959 training samples,
this yields approximately 93 batches per epoch, sufficient for stable optimization.

The 15-epoch training duration was determined empirically: training loss converges by epoch 10-12, and test performance
plateaus around epoch 12 (86.82\% at epoch 12 vs 86.52\% at epoch 15). The minimal training-test accuracy gap (1.78\%)
indicates healthy generalization without overfitting, suggesting that no additional regularization (dropout, weight decay,
data augmentation) was necessary for this baseline. He initialization was used throughout, as it is specifically designed
for ReLU activations and prevents vanishing/exploding gradients by maintaining variance across layers.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

The evaluation framework encompasses quality metrics with clinical relevance, efficiency indicators, and diagnostic visualizations. Metric selection was guided by the specific demands of multi-class blood cell classification where both false positives and false negatives carry medical consequences.

For quality assessment, accuracy provides an intuitive overall correctness measure, computed as $\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{Total Samples}}$. While potentially misleading under severe class imbalance, BloodMNIST's class sizes (ranging 243-666 samples) justify its use when complemented by precision and recall. The weighted F1-score balances precision and recall through their harmonic mean, $F1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$, with class-specific F1 values weighted by support to respect the dataset's distribution. This single-number metric proves essential for model comparison in hematology applications where both missed detections and false alarms are clinically problematic.

Macro-averaged precision and recall treat all 8 cell types equally regardless of frequency, ensuring rare classes receive appropriate attention. Precision, defined per-class as $\text{Precision}_{\text{class}} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}$ and averaged without weighting, measures prediction reliability and minimizes false alarms that trigger unnecessary follow-up testing. Sensitivity (recall), computed as $\text{Recall}_{\text{class}} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}$, captures the critical ability to detect all positive cases—particularly important in medical contexts where missing abnormal cells can delay diagnosis. Specificity complements sensitivity by measuring true negative identification, $\text{Specificity}_{\text{class}} = \frac{\text{TN}}{\text{TN} + \text{FP}}$. In an 8-class problem where each positive class faces 7 "negative" alternatives, our achieved 98.03\% specificity demonstrates excellent discrimination.

Efficiency metrics include parameter count (422,344 trainable parameters) as a proxy for memory requirements and deployment feasibility, relevant for edge devices and mobile microscopy platforms. Test loss provides a continuous, confidence-calibrated metric beyond discrete accuracy, with our value of 0.365 indicating well-calibrated predictions approaching the optimal zero.

Visualization decisions support both performance diagnosis and error analysis. Training and test curves for loss and accuracy diagnose overfitting (diverging curves) versus underfitting (persistently high curves), revealing convergence behavior and informing regularization needs. The confusion matrix heatmap, implemented via Seaborn for publication-quality output, exposes specific inter-class confusions—diagonal dominance signals strong performance while off-diagonal patterns identify systematic errors like Class 3 (Erythroblast) acting as an attractor and Class 5 (Monocyte) proving problematic. The precision-recall bar chart displays side-by-side comparisons per class rather than traditional PR curves because our argmax classification uses fixed thresholds without threshold variation, making per-class bars more interpretable for identifying imbalanced precision/recall requiring targeted improvements.

Implementation evaluates the full test set (3,421 samples) after each training epoch to track learning progression and generate curve data. This per-epoch evaluation strategy, computationally acceptable given dataset size, enables convergence monitoring and provides groundwork for future early stopping implementations.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Training Dynamics}

The training process was monitored across 15 epochs for the CNN model. The training and test loss/accuracy curves demonstrate the model's learning progression:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial Loss}: Training loss starts at 1.58, rapidly decreasing to 0.93 by epoch 2
    \item \textbf{Convergence}: Both training and test losses converge around epoch 10-12
    \item \textbf{Final Training Loss}: 0.313 (epoch 15)
    \item \textbf{Final Test Loss}: 0.365 (epoch 15)
    \item \textbf{Training Accuracy}: Improves from 38.8\% to 88.3\%
    \item \textbf{Test Accuracy}: Improves from 51.6\% to 86.5\%
    \item \textbf{Overfitting}: Minimal gap between training (88.3\%) and test (86.5\%) accuracy indicates good generalization
\end{itemize}

The smooth convergence without significant oscillations suggests that the learning rate (0.001) and batch size (128) are well-tuned for this task. The F1-score improves steadily from 0.447 (epoch 1) to 0.866 (epoch 15), demonstrating consistent learning across all classes.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The CNN model achieves strong performance across all metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Accuracy}: 86.52\% correct classification on unseen test data
    \item \textbf{Balanced Performance}: F1-score of 0.8664 indicates good balance between precision and recall

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Confusion Matrix Analysis}

The confusion matrix reveals detailed per-class performance patterns (Figure~\ref{fig:confusion_matrix}):

\textbf{Strong Performance Classes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class 1} (Eosinophil): 581/624 correct (93.1\%) - best performing class
    \item \textbf{Class 6} (Neutrophil): 638/666 correct (95.8\%) - excellent performance
    \item \textbf{Class 7} (Platelet): 462/470 correct (98.3\%) - nearly perfect
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Challenging Classes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class 0} (Basophil): 189/243 correct (77.8\%) - frequently confused with Class 3 (45 misclassifications)
    \item \textbf{Class 4} (Lymphocyte): 197/243 correct (81.1\%) - confused with Class 3 (36 cases)
    \item \textbf{Class 5} (Monocyte): 156/284 correct (54.9\%) - highest confusion with Class 3 (106 cases)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Patterns:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class 3 Attraction}: Multiple classes misclassified as Class 3 (Erythroblast), suggesting visual similarity
    \item \textbf{Diagonal Dominance}: Strong diagonal indicates overall good classification
    \item \textbf{Rare Confusions}: Very few off-diagonal entries for Classes 6 and 7
\end{itemize}

These patterns suggest that morphological similarities between certain blood cell types (particularly involving Class 3) present the main challenge for the classifier.

\subsection{Architectural Analysis}

\textbf{CNN Architecture Strengths:}

    \item \textbf{Parameter Efficiency}: 422,344 parameters enables efficient training and deployment
    \item \textbf{Translation Invariance}: Max-pooling provides robustness to cell positioning variations
    \item \textbf{Local Connectivity}: Convolutions preserve spatial relationships critical for distinguishing cell types
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Abstraction}: Low-level features (edges, textures) combine into high-level representations (cell shapes, internal structures)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieves 86.52\% test accuracy with stable training
    \item Minimal overfitting: 1.78\% gap between training (88.3\%) and test (86.5\%) accuracy

    \item \textbf{Training vs Test Loss}: Demonstrates smooth convergence from 1.58 to 0.313 (training) and 1.18 to 0.365 (test), with close tracking indicating good regularization
    
    \item \textbf{Training vs Test Accuracy}: Shows consistent improvement from 38.8\% to 88.3\% (training) and 51.6\% to 86.5\% (test), validating model learning
    
    \item \textbf{Confusion Matrix Heatmap}: Reveals per-class performance with strong diagonal, identifying Class 3 (Erythroblast) as a frequent misclassification target
    
    \item \textbf{Precision-Recall Bar Chart}: Displays per-class metrics, highlighting Classes 6 and 7 as top performers and Class 5 as needing improvement
\end{enumerate}

These visualizations enable comprehensive model diagnosis and identify specific areas for future optimization.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Performance Analysis}

The CNN model achieves strong performance (86.52\% accuracy, 0.866 F1-score) on the BloodMNIST dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of convolutional architectures for blood cell classification. Several factors contribute to this success:

    \item Per-class metrics (precision/recall/specificity) enable targeted quality assessment
    \item Confusion matrix analysis identifies specific cell types requiring expert review
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

Our study has several limitations that provide opportunities for future work:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Dataset Size}: While BloodMNIST provides standardized evaluation (17,092 images), larger datasets may improve generalization and rare class performance
    
    \item \textbf{Resolution Constraints}: 28×28 pixel images lose fine-grained morphological details present in high-resolution microscopy, potentially limiting discrimination between visually similar cell types
    
    \item \textbf{Class Imbalance}: Uneven class distribution (ranging from 243 to 666 samples per class in test set) may contribute to performance variations, particularly for Class 5 (Monocyte)
    
    \item \textbf{Single Architecture}: This study focuses on CNN implementation; comparison with other architectures (ResNet, Vision Transformers) could provide additional insights
    
    \item \textbf{No Data Augmentation}: Training without augmentation ensures fair baseline evaluation but may limit performance ceiling; rotation, flipping, and color jittering could improve robustness
    
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Exploration}: Limited tuning of learning rate (0.001), batch size (128), and architecture choices (channel sizes, layer depth) may leave performance optimization potential
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Dataset Validation}: Evaluation limited to BloodMNIST; testing on independent blood cell datasets would better assess real-world generalization
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Directions}

Based on our findings, several promising research directions emerge:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advanced Architectures}: Implement ResNet, DenseNet, or Vision Transformers to evaluate performance gains from deeper networks and attention mechanisms
    
    \item \textbf{Address Class 5 Challenge}: Focus on improving Monocyte classification through class-specific data augmentation, focal loss for class imbalance, and targeted feature engineering for Monocyte-Erythroblast discrimination
    
    \item \textbf{Attention Mechanisms}: Integrate Grad-CAM or attention visualization to understand which cell regions drive predictions, enhancing clinical interpretability
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-Task Learning}: Simultaneous cell classification and counting for comprehensive blood analysis
    
    \item \textbf{Transfer Learning}: Leverage pre-trained models from larger medical imaging datasets to improve feature representations
    
    \item \textbf{Ensemble Methods}: Combine multiple CNN architectures to improve robustness and reduce misclassifications
    
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Quantification}: Bayesian approaches for confidence estimation, critical for clinical decision support
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Dataset Validation}: Evaluate on independent blood cell datasets to assess real-world generalization beyond BloodMNIST
    
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Optimization}: Model compression through quantization, pruning, or knowledge distillation for clinical deployment
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

\end{itemize}

The complete implementation generates four visualization types (loss curves, accuracy curves, confusion matrix heatmap, precision-recall bars) enabling thorough model diagnosis and interpretation. All code, configurations, and training procedures are documented for reproducibility, facilitating further research in automated blood cell analysis.

This study establishes a strong baseline for blood cell classification with CNNs and identifies specific directions for future improvement, particularly addressing class imbalance and challenging cell type discrimination through advanced architectures and targeted optimization strategies.

\section*{Reproducibility Statement}

All code, model configurations, and experimental settings are available in the project repository. The implementation uses standard PyTorch operations and the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset from the MedMNIST collection. Specific hyperparameters are detailed in Table~\ref{tab:hyperparameters}, and the training procedure follows standard practices with fixed random seeds for reproducibility.
