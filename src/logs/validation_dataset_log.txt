    Description: The BloodMNIST is based on a dataset of individual normal cells, captured from individuals without infection, hematologic or oncologic disease and free of any pharmacologic treatment at the moment of blood collection. It contains a total of 17,092 images and is organized into 8 classes. We split the source dataset with a ratio of 7:1:2 into training, validation and test set. The source images with resolution 3×360×363 pixels are center-cropped into 3×200×200, and then resized into 3×28×28.
